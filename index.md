# üíª Digital Rain in C++

## Introduction

This is my C++ GitHub Pages project powered by **Jekyll**.

The goal of this console application is to recreate the iconic ‚Äúdigital rain‚Äù effect from *The Matrix*. It uses the Windows Console API to simulate streams of random characters falling from the top of the screen, with real-time updates to cursor position and text color. The project is organized into multiple files, with a focus on clean structure, modular design, and readable code. I also included a simple test suite to make sure each part of the program works correctly.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

I wrote some basic tests to check that the main functions behave as expected:

- **YPositionFields** ‚Äì checks if positions wrap correctly at the screen height.
- **getAsciiCharacters** ‚Äì makes sure the output is a printable character.
- **Initialize** ‚Äì confirms the screen size is set correctly and columns are initialized.
- **ColumnUpdate** ‚Äì ensures streams update properly and don‚Äôt exceed their limits.

I kept the tests simple and direct, just enough to make sure nothing breaks when I change stuff. Because a lot of the visual output relies on randomness and real-time rendering, most of the testing still had to be done manually.

### Manual Testing

Since this project is visual, I tested it by running it and just watching how it looked. I played around with:

- How the characters flowed ‚Äî if the motion felt clean and natural.
- Different window sizes ‚Äî making sure resizing didn‚Äôt break it.
- Delay, stream length, and how often new characters show up ‚Äî to balance CPU usage and how it looks.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Designed

The first version I had was super flickery. Like, unwatchable levels of flicker. Then I found out about this thing called double buffering in the Windows Console API. Basically, instead of drawing directly to the visible screen, you draw everything to a hidden screen buffer, and then swap it in when it‚Äôs ready. This makes it way smoother.

So I had to manually set up the screen size, control cursor movement, and make sure all drawing happened inside bounds. Like, if the console is 120 wide, the furthest I can draw to is position 119, not 120. Otherwise, it‚Äôll throw off the whole frame.

When setting up the streams, I make sure they start above the screen (like -10 or something), so they fall in gradually instead of just popping up in the middle. And the top of each stream is brighter, then it fades ‚Äî like in the movie.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm 

This section goes over how the actual effect works. The algorithm is simple at first glance, but there‚Äôs a lot of little things you need to get right to make it feel good.

### 1. Setting up the streams

Each stream is a column of characters. Each column is a `std::vector` of pairs. Each pair holds a char and its Y-position. The whole screen is just a list of these columns.

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<char, int>>> streams;
```

During `Initialize()`, I resize the window, set the buffer size, and loop through all columns like this:

```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
    int startY = randomPosition() % height;
    int initialLength = (randomPosition() % (height / 3)) + 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < initialLength; ++i) {
        int yPos = YPositionFields(startY - i, height);
        streams[x].push_back({ getAsciiCharacters(), yPos });
    }
}
```

So each column starts with a few characters at different heights, all falling independently.

---

### 2. Updating Streams (Frame by Frame)

Each frame, I loop through all columns and update them. I shuffle the order just for variation.

```cpp
std::shuffle(columns.begin(), columns.end(), randomPosition);
```

For each column:

- I clear the last character from the screen
- I move all characters down by 1
- I sometimes add a new character at the top (not always, for randomness)
- If the stream is too long, I trim it

```cpp
if ((randomPosition() % 100) < 70 && streams[x].size() < maxLength) {
    int newY = YPositionFields(streams[x][0].second - 1, height);
    streams[x].insert(streams[x].begin(), { getAsciiCharacters(), newY });
}
while (streams[x].size() > maxLength) {
    streams[x].pop_back();
}
```

That 70% chance is what makes the rain feel alive. If every column updated every frame, it would look robotic.

---

### 3. Drawing the Frame

Once I‚Äôve updated all columns, I draw them. I use color to separate the stream head from the body.

```cpp
if (i == 0)
    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, greenColor); // Head (bright)
else if (i == streams[x].size() - 1)
    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, fadedColor); // Tail (dim)
else
    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, baseColor); // Body (normal green)
```

After setting the color, I move the cursor and print the character at its Y-position.

The top of the stream is brighter to make it stand out, and the tail fades out so it feels like it disappears smoothly.

---

### 4. Looping the Animation

Everything above runs inside a never-ending loop:

```cpp
while (true) {
    ColumnUpdate(width, height, streams);
    Sleep(50); // delay to control speed
}
```

And yeah, this loop runs forever. `Sleep(50)` gives it a nice pacing ‚Äî fast enough to be fluid, but slow enough to be readable.

---

## üß† Modern C++ Insight & Reflection

Honestly, I learned a lot just from building this.

- **Vectors and pairs**: Using vectors of `pair<char, int>` was the cleanest way I could think of to track stream characters and their Y-positions together.
- **Randomness**: I used `<random>` and `std::mt19937` instead of `rand()` so the character generation looked less repetitive and felt more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù.
- **Multifile project**: Splitting the code into separate header/source files and test files made everything more manageable.
- **System-level stuff**: Working with the Windows Console API was kinda like diving into the guts of how terminal output works. Cursor positioning, screen size, buffer control ‚Äî all stuff I‚Äôd never touched before.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

It taught me how visual feedback is all about detail ‚Äî like timing, randomness, and subtle effects like brightness or spacing. I had to think about how the console behaves, not just how my logic works. In the end, I think I got it to a point where it actually *feels* like digital rain.
