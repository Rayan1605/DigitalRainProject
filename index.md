# üíª Digital Rain C++
Introduction


This is my C++ GitHub Pages project powered by **Jekyll**.


This C++ console application recreates the iconic ‚Äúdigital rain‚Äù effect from The Matrix. It simulates streams of random characters falling from the top of the screen, using the Windows Console API to control cursor position and text color. The main goal was to build a visually engaging animation while focusing on clean code structure, modular design, and good programming practices. The project is organized across multiple files and includes a set of tests to ensure each part functions correctly.
